# HackerNews with GraphQL

## :warning: WIP :warning:

The code is based on a [HowToGraphQL's tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo) with some personal touches to improve my learning, such as:

- React + Typescript
- Hooks!
- [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) for routing instead of react-router/react-router-dom
- [IDB-Keyval](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval) for local storage instead of LocalStorage

:books: Stack:
- React
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- Typescript
